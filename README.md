# Network-Spreading
Simulate the network-spreading on three theoretical networks including a random, a scale-free network and a small-world network.

## Theoretical Network Generator
In this code, it will generate four theoretical networks, but only three of them (e.g., a random network, a scale-free network and a small-world network) will be used for simulation.

## Network Spreading
In this code, the network-spreading will be simulated on the three networks using susceptible–infective–recovered (SIR) model.<br />

## Network-Spreading Results Visualization
In this code, the network-spreading results of the three networks will visualized in a curve figure.<br />
